            <h3> How did this factors change the church? </h3>
            <p> In the last 5 years the NNZ (North New Zealand) Conference wanted Ponsonby to try and find a way to leasing the church. Because Board and decisions used to only wait on the pastors, but nowadays, they can ,ake their own decisions as long as majority of the PLT are present and vote. They also have an admin team which they can take to the board to save time and are given the right to make certain decisions.</p>

            <h3> Why does this factors influenced the development of Ponsonby SDA Church? 
            </h3>
            <p> Because without the assistance of the Hare family vouching for the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Ponsonby or supplying the timber that was used to build the church their might've never been a SDA Church in New Zealand for years come. </p>

            <h3> How did the factors change Ponsonby SDA Church? </h3>
            <p>  Pacific Migrants to come together for social support, community identity, counselling and language based, and worship. Despite all going church under the same roof they had programs that would allow the Pacific Islanders to speak in their preferred language in front of their people allowing them to express themselves without no barriers. They ran church schools in their mothering tongues allowing for the kids to also learn about God and how their cultures transcribed the bible. </p>

        <div class="text6">
            <h3> Why does this factors influenced the development of Ponsonby SDA Church? </h3>
            <p> Because alot of people migrated to different locations due to rent being raised, discriminatory and broader economic challenges which eventually led to the church members of Ponsonby SDA church spreading all over NZ.</p>
