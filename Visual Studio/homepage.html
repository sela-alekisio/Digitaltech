            <p> <h1> Welcome to Your Guide for AS91916 – Exploring the Development of SDA Communities
            This website has been created to support Year 11 ASDAH students completing the NCEA Religious Studies Achievement Standard AS91916:</h1>
            Examine the development of a community that shares religious or spiritual beliefs. For this standard, you’ll explore how a religious or spiritual community has developed over time. At ASDAH, all students will be focusing on Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) churches, even if you’re not SDA yourself. That’s okay—this site is here to help you understand the beliefs, history, and community life of SDA churches in a way that’s simple, clear, and student-friendly.</p>

            <h3> Established: </h3>
            <p> 1885</p>

            <h3> Location: </h3>
            <p> 46 Surrey Crescent, Grey Lynn, Auckland</p>

            <h3> Demographic:  </h3>
            <p> The city of Auckland is home to the largest population of Polynesians of any city in the world. This demographic is reflected in the number of Polynesian ethnic churches in the Greater Auckland area, most of which grew, either directly or indirectly, from membership links with the Ponsonby church. Thus the Ponsonby church is now referenced as “the mother church” of Polynesian Seventh-day Adventists in Auckland.</p>

            <h3> What are the common key spiritual beliefs that your members share? </h3>
            <p> A cornerstone of the Seventh-day Adventist faith is the observance of the Sabbath, which is celebrated from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. This sacred time is dedicated to rest, worship, and reflection, setting the Adventist community apart from many other Christian denominations. At Ponsonby Seventh-day Adventist Church, this tradition is honored with heartfelt services that focus on scripture, prayer, and communal worship. Members and visitors alike are invited to embrace the Sabbath as a time to disconnect from worldly concerns and reconnect with their faith.</p>

                <h3> Established:  </h3>
                <p> 1990</p>

                <h3> Location:  </h3>
                <p> 2/4 Morningside Drive, Auckland</p>
                <p> Mizpah is in the heart of Mangere close to Mangere Centre. Before the church moves to its location now, they used to have worship in halls all around the area. Some of the halls that Mizpah used to have worship at is ASDAH hall and one of the Council halls on Massey Road on the way to the airport.</p>

                <h3> Demographic:  </h3>
                <p> Mizpah Seven Day Adventist Church is made up of approximately 70% youth, 15% Adults and 15% children. It is a Tongan Church, but it also has an English branch called “Embrace”. Because of the English branch we also have other ethnicities such as Samoans and Cook Islanders although they only make up less than 5% of the church. There are more than 100 baptised members in Mizpah.</p>

                <h3>  What are the common key spiritual beliefs that your members in Mizpah share?  </h3>
                <p>We base all our beliefs and doctrine on the Bible. Other than the fundamentals of the church, Mizpah values its Youth and togetherness. Every Sabbath we make tin fish soup in Church so that the Youth can share a meal and the elderlies can talk and share. The church also does a lot of outreaches to members that no longer attend church because of health issues and for other personal reasons.</p>

                <h3>  How do Mizpah practice their faith as a church community? </h3>
                <p> We have worship 4 times a week, Wednesday evening, Friday evening before the sun sets and twice on Saturday (morning and evening). On Wednesdays and Fridays, we always have the Tongan service first and then the Embrace but on Sabbath we start with the English service and then the Tongan. We try our best to make sure that both groups feel supported and valued. The Embrace is made up mainly of our youths. This is because their programs are carried out in English, and they understand in better than Tongan. </p>
